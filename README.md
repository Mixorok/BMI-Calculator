#  BMI Calculator

![project](project.gif)


## What I created

I made a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many pies or if they need to eat more pies. 

## What I used

* Multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* Created classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
